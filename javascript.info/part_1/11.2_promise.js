//? Delay with a promise
/* 
The built-in function setTimeout uses callbacks. Create a promise-based alternative.

The function delay(ms) should return a promise. That promise should resolve after ms milliseconds, so that we can add .then to it, like this:
*/

function delay(ms) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    setTimeout(resolve, ms);
    reject(new Error('error message'));
  });
  // return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  //   setTimeout(resolve, ms);
  // });
}

delay(3000).then(() => alert('runs after 3 seconds'));
